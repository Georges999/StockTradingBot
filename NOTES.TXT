Data requirement issue:
Yes, the Breakout and Mean Reversion strategies require at least 30 historical bars (price points) to function properly. You're seeing those warnings because you don't have enough historical data points.
The 'signal' error:
This error happens because when strategies can't generate proper signals (due to insufficient data), they don't populate the 'signal' column that the code tries to access later.
Settings recommendations:
For more bars and better operation:
Use --interval 1h instead of 1d to get more data points faster
Increase the period parameter: --period 3mo instead of the default 1mo
Alternatively, start with simpler strategies like MA Crossover or RSI Strategy which need fewer data points
Markets available:
With Alpaca, you can only trade US markets (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX) during regular trading hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time). Alpaca doesn't support international markets.
Change interval to 1h in settings
Disable Breakout and Mean Reversion strategies initially
Start with fewer symbols (2-3) to test
The system needs time to accumulate enough data points (bars) for the more complex strategies, especially when using daily intervals.
